For example in C:\apache-tomcat on windows, or /usr/local/apache-tomcat on Linux/Unix and set CATALINA_HOME environment variable pointing to the installation locations. After a successful startup, the default web applications included with Tomcat will be available by visiting http://localhost:8080/.
